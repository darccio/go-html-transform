go-html-transform
=================

Unofficial mirror of go-html-transform project: an html5 parser and CSS selector based html scraping and transformation library.

This library provides a way to parse, scrape, and transform html5 pages using CSS selector queries.

The html5 parser is still somewhat incomplete but I believe it's more complete than the one in go's repository. It supports a pretty large subset as is right now and I'm making good progress on it.

Patches for defencies you find are greatly appreciated.
